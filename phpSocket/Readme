client.php :
=> Client is provided with a simple UI in which the user needs to enter the message which will be send and with it a key should also be entered which will be use to convert the plain text into cipher text.
=> Validations : User cannot left the message and key fields blank. Also the value of the key should be less than 10.

server.php :
=> Server will recieve the text message and key from the client and will accordingly encrypt the message as cipher text.
=> Server will then send the encryted text to the client.

How to test the program : 
=> The server.php should be executed first and let it load.
=> Then in another tab open the phpSocket.html file. Provide the inputs in it and click on submit button.
=> It will then redirect you to the client.php which will show the original message and with it the encrypted cipher text.
=> The server.php will automatically finish loading after this step and will show the message it recieved from the client.
